# PathPilot

An interactive, web-based educational game that teaches file system navigation using relative and absolute paths. Navigate visual folder trees by entering path commands — a mix between a puzzle game and a navigation simulator.

## Features

- **Visual File Tree** — See the file system as an interactive tree with animated nodes and connecting lines
- **Path Commands** — Type real path commands (`../folder`, `/root/src`) to move a robot character between folders
- **5 Handcrafted Levels** — Progressive difficulty from basics to complex trees with constraints
  - Level 1: The Basics — Learn with a simple tree
  - Level 2: Relative Navigation — Only relative paths allowed
  - Level 3: Fog of War — Partially hidden tree structure
  - Level 4: Under Pressure — Limited moves, no absolute paths
  - Level 5: Deep Dive — Complex tree with deep nesting
- **Random Level Generator** — Generate randomized trees with configurable depth and branching
- **Custom Tree Upload** — Import your own folder structure as JSON
- **Animated Robot Avatar** — Smooth spring-physics movement between nodes
- **Toast Notifications** — Real-time feedback for valid moves, errors, and warnings
- **Responsive Design** — Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard-friendly, high contrast, clear focus states

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd game

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## How to Play

1. **Select a Level** — Choose from 5 built-in levels, upload a custom tree, or generate a random one
2. **Read the Target** — The HUD shows your current position and target folder
3. **Enter a Path** — Type a path command in the terminal input:
   - `../folder` — Go up one level, then into "folder"
   - `../../docs` — Go up two levels, then into "docs"
   - `/root/src/app` — Navigate using an absolute path (if allowed)
   - `.` — Current directory (no movement)
4. **Watch the Robot Move** — Your character animates through each folder
5. **Reach the Target** — Navigate to the highlighted target folder to win

### Path Syntax

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `..` | Go to parent directory |
| `.` | Current directory (no-op) |
| `foldername` | Enter child folder |
| `../sibling` | Go up, then into sibling |
| `/root/path` | Absolute path from root |

## Custom Tree Format

Upload a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "root",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "src",
      "children": [
        { "name": "components", "children": [] },
        { "name": "utils", "children": [] }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "docs",
      "children": []
    }
  ]
}
```
